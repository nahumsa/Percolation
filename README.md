# Percolation 

The simples case of percolation on a square latice with size NÂ² starting from the center and checking if "liquid" arives on any border. For more information on [Percolation Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory).


As a second part of this code, I added a Neural Network (NN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to see if it can learn through supervised learning if a given matrix percolates or not. It is shown that for small N the NN and CNN learns for cases that are far away from the critical point(p_c), but the accuracy drops at p_c. That is a way to measure p_c.

#### To-Do:
[ ] Use a unsupervised learning method
